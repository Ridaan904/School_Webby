      <p class="text-muted">The nature of Christian schools varies enormously from country to country, according to the religious, educational, and political cultures. In some countries, there is a strict separation of church and state, so all religious schools are private; in others, there is an established church whose teachings form an integral part of the state-operated educational system; in yet others, the state subsidizes religious schools of various denominations.</p>

    <p>Today we had our School Debate contest and I was shortlisted in the A team. The topic given was ‘Environment pollution’ and I was really excited as it is a topic close to my heart. The judges were from ABC Technical College, and the BCD University and they looked very stern and strict to me.

      Our team started off well as it had most of the ‘brain boxes’ of our school. Everyone contributed equally to the debate. In the end, when the judges announce the winner, we were overjoyed! The judges commented that though the B team fought well, it was the A team which had knowledge and fluency on its side!</p>

    <p>Competitions are great for students. Besides the opportunity to put their scientific knowledge and skills to the test, they also teach them the relevance of their learning, as well as the importance of teamwork, success and failure.

      With everything from essay, poster and video competitions to practical projects, there’s something to suit everyone’s strengths and interests. (And you yourself can benefit from the array of downloadable materials to use in your lessons, as homework or part of a science club!</p>

        School initiated a programme to mentor selected weak students of class IX. Eight teachers are made mentors to a group of four to five students each. The aim is to identify reasons for their poor academic performance and address them accordingly. Following strategies have been adopted by mentors;

Setting up short term academic performance goals for mentees
Teaching memory techniques
Giving appreciation cards on achievement of goals
Screening of Motivational videos and / or lectures
Peer mentoring
Involving parents to foster supportive environment
Two sessions on memory tips have been conducted focusing on Rhyme Technique and Personal Memory System (PMS) Technique. Motivational videos were also shown to students to keep them inspired to improve their academic performance.

“Delhi government had issued orders several times to withdraw the arbitrarily increased fees by the school but the school management has failed every time to comply with these orders. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had approved the proposal of the Directorate of Education (DoE) to take over the management of Bal Bharti School. This file was sent to the LG, which has now been approved,” said a statement released from the deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s office.

Sisodia, who is also the education minister, also warned other schools: “If any school does this then strict action will be taken against them.”

The school, in a statement, said it has “always functioned under the provisions of DSEAR (Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973) and followed all the judgments of the Delhi high court”. The institute said they are yet to receive any communication from the DoE, adding that it will wait for it to decide their next step.

3.Productivity/Efficiency
So, I just passed out from BBPS Dwarka after spending 14 years in this highly reputed institution. Yes, it has a very good image in west Delhi and is most preferred school in Dwarka after DPS Dwarka.

To start with, my parents say that they were highly satisfied with the institute till class 5. But I feel that all the schools are good enough to provide such basic education and opportunities in co-curricular activities.

Coming to class 6, I still remember the class teacher. She claimed to teach us English but never did so. I don't remember even a single class where she took initiative to teach or just discuss the basic grammar rules. All she did was scaring the hell out of the little children and brag about her husband's job in UK. Every class we would get to hear about how she helped a poor man someday and how intelligent her son was.

It went the same way from 6th to 8th class. Neither the teachers wanted to teach nor the students wanted to learn. One could easily score in the exams by just mugging up from the selected questions given in the copy. Similar situation with mathematics curriculum. Imagine such pattern for mathematics?

And the teachers in 9th and 10th(for the subjects english, math and science) were the same who taught us in class 6.
Spoiler alert: they were the same teachers who taught us in class 11th and 12th too!
I mean, think about it, same science teachers teaching in class 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and of-course class 12, too. (Yes, they are sisters!)

Everything went well in 9th and 10th because no one wanted to study. I literally enjoyed class 10 the most in my entire schooling. But yes, had to depend on coaching institutions for academics because the teachers at school were not qualified enough to teach class 12. There were numerous jokes about them.

Class 11. God, again those two sisters who taught us since class 9 and one of them since class 6? Not only they were not qualified enough but had preset image for the students they were going to teach! Being a sophisticated and sincere guy I didn't experience as much hardships as my friends.

Observing my more interest and attention towards coaching institute than the school, the school began troubling me. No half days for coaching exam? I mean either you teach or at least let someone else do it! I know how I managed to attend school, sit for the school exam and then directly go to coaching institute , attend a 4 hour long class (without a break) and then return home by changing three different metro trains. All that helped me survive was Tzinga (energy drink). Just because the school didn't allow me to gt back home after writing the school exam. I am not saying I was the only one but it would have a been a lot simpler if I was allowed a half day.

Also, if you take your problem regarding a subject teacher to the principal, she's going to send that particular subject teacher directly to you rather than resolving the issue maturely.

And class 12? Bullshit. They expect you make copies. Yes, fucking projects too, which were different from those that we had to prepare for CBSE practicals. And again copies to be submitted every month. They even had problem with the registers which didn't have the school logo on them. Come on, firstly I found a register at my home, copied all the assignments in it and at the time of submission they ask for a school register? The same day, I was made to copy all the assignments once again into the school register in the school. Class teacher, the maths teacher sucked. She finished up the topic differentiation in just 3 periods of 30 minutes each out of which she could hardly teach for 15-20 minutes. "Imagine continuation and differentiation in an hour or so."
Still I respected every teacher. But got low marks in CBSE practical even when I was able to answer all the viva questions. They were partial.

In nutshell, the teachers here at BBPS Dwarka suck, they really do. Good for nothing, they are.
And am anonymous because if I wasn't, I would probably get a call in a day or two from the school to take down this post as it has happened before also. They try to threaten students in such case.

And yes, they have a very cool ground with all kind of courts in it BUT they won't unlock it unless another school is coming for some sort of competition or tournament i.e. students are not allowed to use it till such a situation ooccurs.
